Maria Somma, then program director of the University YMCA, organized the trip along with 22 volunteers. They lived and worked for a week in the Rio Grande Valley with the refugees.

In 1990, ASB expanded the program with three trips: a return trip to the Rio Grande Valley, a trip to Harlem dealing with homelessness, and a trip to South Dakota working with Native American issues. Since then, ASB has grown to offer a variety of trips.

After COVID, the group was re-formed by YMCA Student Board President and current ASB co-president Lily Rybka in 2023.

ASB is still a program of the University YMCA and continues working to provide university students the opportunity to directly work with and learn about a variety of social justice issues.</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
