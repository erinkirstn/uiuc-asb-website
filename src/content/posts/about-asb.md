**Alternative Seasonal Breaks** is a 100% student run, non-profit volunteer organization of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and the University YMCA.

Each trip offers participant a unique, hands-on opportunity to make a difference in the lives of both communities and individuals nation-wide.

ASB's mission is to educate students about social, political, and environmental issues through direct service, group reflections, student leadership, diversity, and engagement beyond the local community. Participants will develop empathy and be motivated to action with the local community.
